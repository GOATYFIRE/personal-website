        <h1 class="LeeGoaat">Lee's Goats</h1>
        <h3 class="goattext">My name is lee justice, I am 12 and in the 6th grade as of right now. Beside me learning how to code I also show goats. Goats are a really fun thing to try. Anyway, I have shown for 3 years and I am now on my 4th year. I have won showmen ship and have gotten have gotten very close to get reserve champion in market. Bespite that i have made sale every year and i don't plan on messing up this year. As of today I have two goats. I am planing on having three goats like how i've done the past 2 years. My 2 goats are named stiltz (stilts) and the other named even steven. The reason we named each one how they are is because stiltz had to were stilts to straighten his front legs and even steven because his lot number was 10. Wierd names I know but it just works.</p>
            <p class="ten">10</p>

            <h1 class="future">Plans for the future</h1>
            <h3 class="plantext">I have a lot planed for my future. I want to start my own business and even continue my goat project with my family and even breed some of my own. I don't want to tell the name or what I will be making/selling but I do want to share my thoughts for my breeding business. I don't know what the exact name will be but I have a feeling that I will do something with Goatyfire. It is a funny name but that is the name I have used for a lot of my goat projects. But that isn't it. I also want to do something with coding, 2 things really. The first thing I want to do is code somthing to help ag like a thing that could into the ground and scan miles and test soil levels and give cordents of everything. That would also mean I would need knowledge in engineering but I could find someone to do that if I really didn't want to do engineering. But, I said I wanted to do 2 things. Well, I want to make a game console aswell. This would not only be a console but it would come with a VR headset. I want to make a console that can be played on the couch and in a 3d atmostphere. </h3>
